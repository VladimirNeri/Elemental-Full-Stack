      <h1>Submission Guidlines</h1>
      <p>
        We only take exclusive submissions meaning they are UNPUBLISHED, having
        not been shown on Facebook, Tumblr, blogs or any other public forum. The
        published story remains a Elemental Exclusive after being published.
        Successful submissions will be notified via email. Elemental reserves the
        right to accept or deny any submissions we receive. By submitting your
        work, you give full consent for Elemental to publish your work in the
        magazine, website and/or shared via social media. Please note that due
        to the sheer amount of emails we receive daily we unfortunately cannot
        reply to every submission sent.
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting an exclusive story to Elemental you agree not to send the
        accepted and published story to any other magazine or website and give
        sole discretion to Elemental to use/post your work in anyway to Elemental,
        unless rejected, or the 30-day period concludes in which case you may
        submit and publish elsewhere. When submitting, please provide your
        personal bio, any links to social media profiles and portfolios, along
        with credits and links to involved team members.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must be the copyright-owner of the artwork or photographs to submit
        them. Be aware that when submitting your contribution you agree to
        grant Elemental the right to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, create
        derivative works, distribute, make available to the public, and/or to
        incorporate your contribution in other works in any media. Elemental
        reserve the right to re-edit any imagery and to use cropped versions of
        your work when producing our editorials and you as an artist understand
        that the editorial itself is someoneâ€™s artwork. We have the rights to
        remove your editorial at any stage.
